## Overview
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, performing data cleaning, and developing interactive geospatial visualizations. The project aims to provide insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends in Airbnb listings.

## Technologies Used
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Folium
- MongoDB Atlas

## Problem Statement
The project's primary goal is to analyze Airbnb data, clean and prepare the dataset, and develop interactive geospatial visualizations for pricing, ratings, and other relevant factors. The specific objectives include:

1. Establish a MongoDB connection and retrieve the Airbnb dataset for efficient analysis.
2. Clean and prepare the dataset, addressing missing values, duplicates, and ensuring accurate data types.
3. Develop a Streamlit web application with interactive maps to showcase the distribution of Airbnb listings.
4. Conduct price analysis and visualization, exploring variations based on location, property type, and seasons.
5. Analyze availability patterns across seasons, visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations.
6. Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.
7. Create interactive visualizations allowing users to filter and drill down into the data.
8. Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI, presenting key insights from the analysis.
